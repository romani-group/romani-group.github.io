            Pulsar X-Ray Filaments
        </h3>
        <p>
            Several long, thin, &#8220;filament&#8221; structures have been detected shooting out from nearby pulsars. They&rsquo;re made of electrons and positrons recently manufactured by the pulsar and shooting into the ambient medium at as much as 99.9999999999% (twelve 9&rsquo;s) the speed of light.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our twin effort is to find more filaments to characterize them, and build a physical model for the particles&rsquo; propagation through space. Do they reach Earth? Are the positrons we detect in the upper atmosphere brought to us by these filaments? See the <a href="https://jack-dinsmore.github.io/filament-website/filament.html">interactive figure</a> for a display of my results. <a href="">[arXiv:---]</a>
