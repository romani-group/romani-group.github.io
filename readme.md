## Instructions

If you are adding a major upgrade to the website and want to take it down, consider either
1) Unpublishing the website under the "Settings > Pages" menu in GitHub
2) Renaming "devel.html" to "index.html" which will make "romani-group.github.io" point to a website-in-development page instead of the home page.
