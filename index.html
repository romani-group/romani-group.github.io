            Prof. Romani&rsquo;s group use observations and theoretical modeling of compact objects to probe the boundaries of fundamental physics. Prof. Romani has a long-standing interest in pulsars and their high energy emission. One recent project studies how the so-called &#8220;black widow&#8221; pulsars heat and evaporate low mass binary companions (enabling neutron star mass measurements to constrain QCD at super-nuclear densities). Other efforts measure pulsar synchrotron nebula, to understand the acceleration of multi-TeV e+/e- and their Galactic propagation. On cosmic scales, the group studies the relativistic jets of super-massive black holes, with particular foci on jets in the early universe and on their high energy emission. The work is sparked by new observations ranging across the E-M spectrum, using ground- and spaced- based telescopes, and is directed at modeling source emission physics. Particularly exciting is the new mission IXPE, for which the group is leading novel X-ray polarization studies of a range of astrophysical accelerators.
